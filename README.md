Factorial Calculation

This MATLAB script calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

How to Use:

Run the Script:

Save the code as a .m file (e.g., factorial_calculator.m).
Open MATLAB and run the script by typing factorial_calculator in the Command Window and pressing Enter.
Customization:

Modify the value of n to calculate the factorial of a different number.
Code Explanation:

Initialization:
n: Specifies the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.
factorial_result: Initializes the factorial result to 1.
For Loop:
The for loop iterates from 1 to n.
In each iteration, the current value of i is multiplied with the factorial_result.
The result is stored back in factorial_result.
Output:
The final value of factorial_result is the factorial of n.
The disp function is used to display the calculated factorial.
